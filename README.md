# CTF Code

This is the entire database of code that I wrote for [CTF](https://github.com/cyclops-community/ctf) working in [LPNA](http://lpna.cs.illinois.edu/) under Edgar Solomonik.

### finite_element

This is code to show proof-of-concept within CTF, mainly to practice getting used to CTF and show explore tensor notation for the first time. Summer 2017.

### gather

This code was what the majority of my summer 2017 was spent working on. More information can be found [on this talk](http://lpna.cs.illinois.edu/talks/7_27_17.pdf). The final code is included in gather_irreg.cxx.

### sgd

This code focused on implementing SGD with various methods and using CTF python. Slides will be up soon.
